# Digital Asset Manager
Do you have a collection of photos, or digital artwork that is just a bunch of files in one or more folders on a disk?
Wouldn't it be nice to catalog them in a database with descriptions, categories, and tags to make them easy to search for?

Digital Asset manager is the answer.

This simple tool uses ImageMagick as a backend to extract information from your image files, and put it into a database where you can describe them, and catalog them in a simple, straightforward way.

Once your images are cataloged, you can search for them, and download them in various formats and sizes.

Handles many common file types, and can run on any compatible web server.
